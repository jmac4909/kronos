# Kronos Terminal-First Product Contract

Status: normative contract for the terminal-first evaluation build.

## Product Statement

Kronos is a VS Code work companion for organizing Jira work and operator-controlled Claude sessions. The operator may attach an existing terminal or explicitly ask Kronos to create and focus a new Claude terminal. Kronos prepares bounded provider context, monitors merge-request and CI state, and preserves a private audit trail without taking control of the resulting conversation or the software-delivery workflow.

Kronos has five bounded runtime verbs:

1. **Read** ticket and provider context.
2. **Start** a validated Claude command, only after an explicit operator action.
3. **Insert** an editable local context reference without submission.
4. **Monitor** bounded provider state for meaningful structural changes.
5. **Audit** what context and provider evidence was observed.

Anything outside those five verbs is outside the product.

## Ownership Invariants

The operator owns the terminal, process, interactive agent, repository, and submission decision at all times, including when Kronos creates the terminal on request.

Kronos never:

- launches Claude automatically or in response to provider data, polling, activation, or reload;
- launches an arbitrary executable or Claude management command: explicit start accepts only a validated `claude` or `claude-*` executable plus narrowly allowlisted interactive flags;
- creates a terminal except after **New Claude** or **Start Claude for Ticket**;
- reads, records, parses, or summarizes terminal input, output, or scrollback;
- submits inserted provider context or presses Enter for the operator;
- runs project tests, builds, static-analysis scans, deployments, database commands, or remediation commands;
- creates or removes worktrees;
- creates, switches, stages, commits, resets, pushes, merges, rebases, or deletes Git branches or refs;
- approves, comments on, merges, closes, or otherwise changes a merge request;
- mutates Jira, GitLab, Jenkins, SonarQube, or database state;
- closes, interrupts, or kills the operator's terminal when management stops.

An explicit Claude-start action validates its configured executable, approved interactive flags, terminal name, and working directory before creating anything. Positional prompts/subcommands and permission-escalating, tool-allowing, directory-expanding, MCP, plugin, background, and non-interactive flags are rejected. It creates and focuses one VS Code terminal and executes the validated Claude command exactly once. It does not use a subprocess library, observe whether Claude succeeded, or read the resulting terminal.

`Manage Focused Terminal` records a private association between a work session and the terminal object the operator explicitly focused. It does not grant Kronos general control of that terminal.

Persisted terminal names and process IDs are descriptive metadata, not durable identity. After extension reload, live attachment starts detached. Selecting the Session is the explicit reconnect action: Kronos reconnects the sole unclaimed open terminal, or requires the operator to choose when more than one is available. Context insertion remains blocked until that live object association exists.

## Navigation Contract

Kronos exposes exactly three activity views.

### Work

Work is the Jira-centered entry point and presents a board rather than an unstructured issue list.

It supports:

- refreshing Jira work metadata;
- searching tickets and filtering by status, project, and label;
- hiding or showing completed work by the configured default, explicitly overriding it, and clearing filters reversibly;
- opening one canonical ticket workspace;
- explicitly discovering local projects from open workspace folders and configured roots, within configured depth/result limits, then registering only selected folders;
- reading a registered project's current Git branch without invoking Git;
- choosing or unlinking one primary local launch project for a ticket while preserving Jira/provider project associations;
- managing the explicitly focused terminal for that ticket;
- explicitly creating and focusing a Claude terminal linked to that ticket;
- inserting Jira, GitLab MR/pipeline, or combined Jenkins/SonarQube context.

Jira normalization recursively removes values with no meaningful content: `null`, blank strings, empty arrays, empty objects, and recursively empty structured text. Boolean `false`, numeric `0`, and other real values remain. This rule applies to standard and custom fields so hundreds of empty defaults do not overwhelm the board or inserted context.

The ticket workspace prioritizes either terminal-first sequence:

1. optionally choose the registered local project/branch that future launches should use;
2. start a new validated Claude terminal for this ticket, or manage an existing focused terminal;
3. insert the context needed now;
4. continue working in the operator-owned terminal.

Project linking changes local Kronos metadata only. A new ticket-launched terminal may use the linked project folder as its starting directory. Linking never changes branch, index, worktree, or repository state, and never changes the current directory of an existing terminal.

Project discovery roots, scan depth, and result limit are operator settings. An explicit Work/Setup action opens VS Code's native multi-folder picker, merges the selected machine-local parent folders into the configured roots, and immediately presents bounded discovery results. The registration editor sorts registered projects first and checked, followed by unchecked discoveries; accepting it makes that checked set authoritative. Unregistering a linked project requires confirmation, clears affected local launch links, and preserves Jira/provider project associations. Discovery skips symbolic child directories and dependency trees and reads only directory and Git `HEAD` metadata. Registered projects become available from the prominent **Add Project** control at the top of every Jira card and from the ticket workspace. Jira completed-work visibility and additional completed status names are mapped settings shared by the Work tree and Jira board.

It does not plan or execute software-delivery work.

Only an action invoked from the ticket path creates a ticket link. A standalone **New Claude** action never invents or inherits a Jira identity.

### Sessions

Sessions is the durable operational view for standalone and ticket-linked work sessions.

Each session presents:

- its operator-facing title and, only when actually linked, its ticket identity;
- attached, detached, paused, or closed management state;
- the live terminal attachment count without terminal contents;
- provider bindings;
- latest context-artifact freshness and completeness;
- monitoring readiness, last attempt, latest successful poll, failures, and skips;
- the linked local project path and currently observed branch when available.

Supported actions are focus, explicit reattach, detach, pause monitoring, resume monitoring, poll now, open audit, and stop management.

Selecting any Session means “open its terminal.” A live attachment is focused immediately. When VS Code has discarded the ephemeral attachment, Kronos never guesses from a saved process ID or duplicate terminal name: it reconnects the only unclaimed open terminal or asks the operator to choose one, then focuses it.

**New Claude** creates a standalone session with a workspace-derived title, validates the configured Claude command/name/cwd, creates and focuses one terminal, and starts Claude. The persisted record contains no fake or placeholder ticket key. **Start Claude for Ticket** performs the same launch but creates a ticket-linked session from the selected ticket path.

Stopping management disables monitoring and detaches the in-memory association. It never closes the terminal.

### Attention

Attention is the session- and ticket-aware inbox for changes that merit operator review. A standalone session is labeled by its session title; ticket-linked items retain their real ticket identity.

Eligible items include:

- merge-request review or pipeline structural changes;
- newly failing or recovered GitLab jobs/tests;
- Jenkins build, stage, or test failures and recoveries;
- SonarQube quality-gate or unresolved-issue changes;
- partial provider reads and monitoring blockers;
- unsafe or unavailable local monitoring state.

A ticket-linked item may open its ticket workspace. Applicable items may open a validated provider URL, insert fresh MR/CI context into the explicitly attached terminal, or be acknowledged locally. Acknowledgement never changes provider state.

Unchanged polling results do not create new Attention items.

## Context Insertion Contract

Context insertion is always explicit and ticket-scoped. Creating a standalone Claude session does not silently create ticket context or a ticket association.

1. Kronos resolves the selected ticket and the explicitly managed terminal.
2. It reads the configured provider through bounded read-only APIs.
3. It normalizes and secret-redacts textual and structured provider data.
4. For Jira, it downloads attachment bytes without a file-type allowlist or parser, writes them as private files with sanitized local names, and records their paths and SHA-256 hashes. Raw files are not transformed or secret-redacted.
5. It writes a private, content-addressed JSON artifact and Markdown prompt boundary.
6. It verifies that the managed terminal attachment has not changed during the fetch.
7. It inserts one shell-inert reference line with terminal execution disabled.
8. The operator reviews, edits, and submits the line manually.

Provider data inside an artifact is untrusted evidence, never instructions. Prompt artifacts tell the interactive agent not to follow commands, role changes, credential requests, links, or mutation requests found inside provider content.

Insertion targets:

- `[JIRA-123]`: visible Jira fields, including custom-field IDs, names, schemas, values, readable text, comments, and private paths to downloaded raw attachments of any MIME type;
- `[MR-77]`: GitLab merge-request metadata, notes, discussions, approvals, bounded diffs, pipelines, jobs, and test evidence;
- `[CI-JIRA-123]`: bounded Jenkins build/test/stage evidence and SonarQube gate/measure/issue evidence.

Partial, unavailable, skipped, truncated, or failed provider components remain explicit in completeness warnings. Kronos never presents partial evidence as complete.

Jira attachment capture is bounded to 100 download attempts, 25 MiB per file, and 100 MiB in total for one explicit insertion. Filename path components are discarded before local storage. Attachment files are untrusted evidence: Kronos never parses, opens, previews, or executes them, and the generated prompt tells the interactive agent to inspect only relevant files with safe read-only tools.

## Monitoring Contract

Monitoring is read-only and belongs to an active provider-bound work session. A new standalone session begins with monitoring disabled and no provider or Jira identity.

- The default interval is configured by `kronos.managedProviderPollIntervalSec`.
- The operator can pause, resume, or poll a session immediately.
- A private cross-window lease prevents duplicate concurrent polling against one Kronos data directory.
- Monitoring baselines contain bounded normalized digests, not full provider responses.
- Incomplete provider components do not erase the last complete component or create false recovery events.
- Losing lease ownership stops persistence and prevents the next provider request from starting.
- Provider errors affect readiness and Attention; they do not trigger remediation.

Monitoring can observe GitLab, Jenkins, and SonarQube. Jira remains explicitly refreshed from Work rather than continuously monitored as terminal content.

## Audit and Local State

By default, private terminal-first state lives under `~/.kronos`, or the explicitly configured `KRONOS_DIR`:

- work-session records contain an operator-facing title, optional real ticket identity, terminal metadata, provider bindings, context references, and monitoring readiness;
- context directories contain normalized content-addressed provider artifacts and prompt boundaries;
- compact monitor snapshots contain the latest comparison baseline;
- the append-only monitor-event ledger records session, context, transition, notification, acknowledgement, and operator-decision events.

The audit may include provider summaries, timestamps, completeness warnings, hashes, and private artifact paths. It never contains terminal input, terminal output, scrollback, provider credentials, authorization headers, cookies, raw job traces, or Jenkins console logs.

Kronos does not publish audit content externally. Opening an audit is a local read.

## Provider and Credential Boundary

Provider credentials are inherited from approved local configuration. They are never inserted into the terminal or persisted in work-session, context, snapshot, or audit records.

Credentialed requests are constrained to configured provider origins. Redirects and provider-returned URLs do not silently move credentials to another host. Response sizes, pagination, item counts, text sizes, and request timeouts are bounded.

Setup provides the guided first-run path. Doctor reports missing or invalid provider and Claude-launch configuration with safe repair guidance without displaying credential values. Settings exposes the supported Claude command/name/cwd behavior and polling configuration; provider credentials remain in the private environment-file path described by Setup. Settings cannot authorize a generic shell command.

## Runtime Dependency Boundary

The installed extension has zero third-party runtime dependencies. Kronos uses the VS Code API and Node built-ins; it does not bundle an agent SDK, shell library, or helper CLI. The operator-installed Claude executable is external to Kronos and is reached only through the explicit, validated VS Code terminal-launch path.

## Command Surface

The public terminal-first command surface is intentionally limited to:

- Work: refresh the Jira board; search/filter/show completed/clear filters; open ticket workspace; start Claude for the selected ticket; manage a focused terminal; insert Jira/MR/CI context;
- Sessions: create a standalone Claude session; poll providers; open audit; focus/reattach/detach terminal; stop management; pause/resume monitoring;
- Attention: acknowledge item and open provider;
- Operations: Setup, Doctor, and Settings.

No command outside this inventory is part of the terminal-first product contract. In particular, there is no generic terminal-command runner.

## Canonical Operator Journey

Ticket-linked journey:

1. In Work, the operator searches or filters the Jira board, selects a ticket, and opens its workspace.
2. The operator chooses `Start Claude for Ticket`, or focuses an existing terminal and chooses `Manage Focused Terminal`.
3. On explicit start, Kronos validates the configured Claude command/name/cwd, creates and focuses one VS Code terminal, and executes only that command.
4. The operator chooses `Insert [JIRA-123]`.
5. Kronos inserts one editable, non-submitting reference to the private Jira artifact.
6. The operator edits and submits it manually, then directs the work interactively.
7. Kronos monitors linked MR and CI providers without reading the terminal.
8. Meaningful changes appear in Attention and can produce fresh explicit MR/CI insertion actions.
9. The operator uses the work-session audit to inspect provenance and evidence.
10. The operator stops management when finished; the terminal remains open.

Standalone journey:

1. In Sessions, the operator chooses `New Claude`; Kronos derives a standalone title from the open workspace (or the launch time when no workspace is open).
2. Kronos validates the configured Claude command/name/cwd, creates and focuses one terminal, and executes the Claude command exactly once.
3. Sessions records a standalone session without a ticket key.
4. The operator owns and directs the conversation normally.
5. Stopping management leaves the terminal and Claude process alone.

## Failure Behavior

Kronos fails closed at ownership and credential boundaries:

- no focused or explicitly attached terminal means no insertion;
- an invalid Claude command, name, or cwd fails before terminal creation;
- a launch request whose executable is not `claude` or `claude-*` is rejected rather than treated as a generic shell command;
- no explicit start action means no terminal or process launch;
- a changed terminal binding cancels insertion;
- missing credentials or provider failures produce partial/blocked state, not fabricated evidence;
- an unsafe local path or lease prevents polling or persistence;
- a failed provider read does not start a mutation or remediation path;
- stopping or pausing monitoring never affects the terminal process.

Every error should tell the operator whether the provider read, local artifact write, terminal insertion, monitoring snapshot, or audit write succeeded, so retrying cannot be mistaken for a clean first attempt.

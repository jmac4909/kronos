![Kronos Jira Work Board with synthetic tickets, sessions, and provider state](docs/assets/kronos-work-board.png)

Kronos solves a narrow enterprise-development problem: the evidence needed for a coding task is spread across work tracking, source control, builds, and code quality tools, while the actual AI-assisted work happens in an interactive terminal. Kronos organizes that evidence without turning the editor into an autonomous executor.

## What Kronos Delivers

| Surface | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| **Work** | Search and filter Jira work, explicitly link the right local project and branch, then open a focused ticket workspace. Shared Jira keys never infer a repository. |
| **Sessions** | Organize operator-owned Claude terminals by local project, attach multiple Jira contexts when useful, and never read terminal contents. |
| **Projects** | Track each registered repository's current branch and clean/dirty status, then open bounded diff, MR, CI, and provider actions. |
| **Attention** | Show the newest meaningful provider state by project, resurface still-open MRs after the next poll, and retain full history in the private audit. |
| **Context composer** | Review fetched evidence, edit the focus, and place one shell-inert line in the chosen terminal with submission disabled. |

### A 60-second workflow

1. Select a Jira ticket and its local project.
2. Attach a terminal you already own, or explicitly choose **Start Claude for Ticket**.
3. Fetch bounded Jira, GitLab, Jenkins, or SonarQube evidence.
4. Review the normalized evidence as untrusted data and edit the operator focus.
5. Choose **Place in Terminal**. Kronos inserts the line with execution disabled.
6. Decide whether to press Enter yourself; later provider changes appear in **Attention** and the session audit.

![Kronos two-step context review and post-insertion terminal sequence, using synthetic data](docs/assets/kronos-context-composer.png)

The second render is an explicitly labeled interaction sequence: the composer is shown before insertion, and the terminal panel shows the state after the composer closes. Both renders use deliberately synthetic `DEMO-*` records and example-only provider state. They contain no live credentials, employer data, usernames, or machine paths.

## Human-in-the-Loop by Construction

Kronos has two intentional terminal-write boundaries:

| Boundary | Allowed behavior | Guardrail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Explicit Claude launch | Create and focus a new terminal after **New Claude** or **Start Claude for Ticket** | Accepts only a validated `claude` or `claude-*` executable and narrowly allowlisted, non-escalating interactive flags |
| Context insertion | Place a reviewed reference and editable focus in an attached terminal | Uses shell-inert quoting and VS Code's `sendText(..., false)`; Kronos never presses Enter |

Kronos reads, organizes, inserts, monitors, and audits. It does **not**:

- launch automatically or expose a generic command runner;
- read terminal input, output, or scrollback;
- submit inserted text;
- run project tests, builds, scans, deployments, or remediation;
- create, switch, commit, push, merge, or otherwise mutate Git;
- write to Jira, GitLab, Jenkins, SonarQube, or a database;
- close an operator's terminal.

The complete normative boundary is in the [terminal-first product contract](docs/terminal-first-product-contract.md).

    class C,T boundary;
    class G,S,M local;
```

The installed extension uses the VS Code API and Node built-ins only. It has **zero third-party runtime dependencies** and does not bundle an agent SDK, subprocess helper, or provider client library.

### Engineering proof

| Measure | Current preview |
| --- | ---: |
| Enterprise provider integrations | 4 |
| Focused VS Code views | 4 |
| Audited terminal-write paths | 2 |
| Manifest-covered commands | 36 |
| Manifest-covered settings | 10 |
| Reachable runtime modules checked for cycles/dead exports | 66 |
| Third-party runtime dependencies | 0 |
| Automated Node/DOM/board tests | 86 |

Automated gates also cover the runtime graph, security boundary, context governance, activation surface, provider transitions, private state, credential redaction, and packaged extension contents.

## Try It Locally

Requirements:

- Node.js 20 or newer
- VS Code 1.85 or newer
- the Claude CLI only if you choose to exercise explicit terminal launch

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Kronos
npm ci
npm test
npm run package
code --install-extension kronos-0.1.0.vsix --force
```

Reload VS Code and open the Kronos activity icon. The extension exposes exactly four views: **Work**, **Sessions**, **Projects**, and **Attention**.

### Isolated synthetic fixture

```bash
npm run feedback:state
KRONOS_DIR="$PWD/.kronos/feedback-state" code .
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
npm run feedback:state
$env:KRONOS_DIR = "$PWD\.kronos\feedback-state"
code .
```

The fixture uses `.invalid` provider URLs. It must not contact or mutate real systems, and it never starts a terminal automatically.

## Configuration

Kronos reads provider credentials from the extension process environment and, when present, `~/.kronos/.env` or `KRONOS_ENV_FILE`. Credential values are never written to context artifacts, work-session records, URLs, or audit events.

| Provider | Required values | Optional values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Jira | `JIRA_BASE_URL`, `JIRA_EMAIL`, `JIRA_API_TOKEN` | `JIRA_JQL` |
| GitLab | `GITLAB_TOKEN` | `GITLAB_API_BASE_URL` or `GITLAB_BASE_URL` |
| Jenkins | `JENKINS_URL` | `JENKINS_USER` / `JENKINS_USERNAME`, `JENKINS_API_TOKEN` / `JENKINS_TOKEN`, narrowly scoped `JENKINS_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=false` for a locally trusted corporate endpoint |
| SonarQube | `SONAR_HOST_URL` or `SONAR_URL`, `SONAR_TOKEN` | project and branch bindings configured per local project |

Use **Kronos: Setup** for guided configuration and **Kronos: Doctor** for readiness checks. They share one readiness snapshot, expose one bounded action per row, and never display credential values. **Open Private Config** creates a private comment-only template when needed; save provider values there, then refresh Setup or Doctor. **Poll Now** verifies configured project monitoring without mutating a provider.

Local state is stored under `~/.kronos` by default or an explicitly configured `KRONOS_DIR`. On the first default-path start, Kronos safely migrates an existing legacy `~/.claude/kronos` directory without requiring a Python helper. Provider payloads are normalized, bounded, secret-redacted, wrapped as untrusted data, and written to private per-user files where the platform supports private permissions.

For a Jenkins controller whose certificate chain is supplied only by a corporate workstation trust setup, prefer installing the corporate CA for Node. If that is not possible, `JENKINS_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=false` disables certificate verification only for Kronos Jenkins requests; it does not weaken Jira, GitLab, or SonarQube transport.

## Validation

```bash
npm ci
npm test
npm run feedback:smoke
npm run package
npm run feedback:ready
```

`npm test` begins with a public-surface gate that rejects tracked local-state directories, machine-specific home paths, employer identifiers, private-key material, and high-confidence token shapes. The remaining checks enforce the manifest allowlist, reachable runtime graph, explicit-launch boundary, context governance, strict TypeScript compilation, unit behavior, and dependency-free webviews.

For the interactive pass, use [HUMAN_FEEDBACK_CHECKLIST.md](HUMAN_FEEDBACK_CHECKLIST.md). Real-provider, terminal-focus, and Windows feedback remain explicit human gates; see the [completion audit](docs/terminal-first-completion-audit.md).

## Current Limits

- Kronos is a local VS Code extension preview, not a hosted backend or autonomous software-development agent.
- Marketplace publication, adoption, production-scale operation, and live-provider compatibility are not claimed.
- Real VS Code/Claude, provider, focus/reattachment, and Windows checks require recorded human feedback.
- Raw Jira attachments are stored byte-for-byte under strict count and size limits; they are never parsed or executed by Kronos.
- This repository is source-available for review, not open source.
- The public repository is a sanitized source snapshot; private development-history metadata is intentionally excluded from the portfolio release.

# Changelog

All notable changes to the Kronos preview are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Prioritized extension improvement roadmap covering identity, terminal lifecycle, provider reconciliation, Attention, cross-platform persistence, UX, maintainability, and release evidence.
- Dedicated Projects view with current branch, clean/dirty status, read-only Git loading, and existing project evidence actions.
- Recruiter-facing product overview, architecture, engineering metrics, and synthetic product renders.
- Branded Marketplace icon and preview metadata.
- Public-surface validation for tracked local state, machine paths, employer identifiers, private keys, and high-confidence token shapes.
- Security, support, and contribution guidance.

### Changed

- Migrated the Work catalog to schema v2 with `linked_local_project` as the only ticket-to-repository identity; schema-v1 `launch_project` records migrate safely and legacy project tags are discarded.
- Separated Jira namespace metadata from local repository links; tickets now use only explicit operator-selected projects for launch and provider configuration.
- Generalized repository instructions so they do not assume a specific machine or workspace path.
- Clarified that the public source is available for portfolio and security review under an all-rights-reserved evaluation license.
- Renamed the merge-request browser action to make clear that Kronos opens a page but does not create an MR.
- Corrected informational pills to use the information color rather than the success color.
- Reworked realistic credential-shaped test literals so public secret scanners do not mistake fixtures for live values.

## 0.1.0 - Unreleased preview

### Added

- Four focused VS Code views: Work, Sessions, Projects, and Attention.
- Jira work board with bounded local filtering and project/branch linkage.
- Explicit validated Claude terminal launch and non-submitting context insertion.
- Read-only Jira, GitLab, Jenkins, and SonarQube clients.
- Private context artifacts, provider monitoring, transitions, and session audit.
- Manifest, runtime-graph, security-boundary, context-governance, unit, DOM, board, fixture, and package validation.

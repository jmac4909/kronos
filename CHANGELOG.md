# Changelog

All notable changes to the Kronos preview are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Prioritized extension improvement roadmap covering identity, terminal lifecycle, provider reconciliation, Attention, cross-platform persistence, UX, maintainability, and release evidence.
- Dedicated Projects view with current branch, clean/dirty status, read-only Git loading, and existing project evidence actions.
- Recruiter-facing product overview, architecture, engineering metrics, and synthetic product renders.
- Branded Marketplace icon and preview metadata.
- Public-surface validation for tracked local state, machine paths, employer identifiers, private keys, and high-confidence token shapes.
- Security, support, and contribution guidance.

### Changed

- Added one redacted actionable failure vocabulary for provider reads and common operator workflows, distinguishing configuration, authentication, permission, timeout, DNS, TLS, redirect, rate limit, not found, response bound, malformed response, pagination, lease contention, local state, network, and unknown availability failures.
- Added one Session lifecycle projection shared by Sessions, polling readiness, and command guards; terminal exit is now durable `closed` history, explicit detach remains `detached`, and stopping management detaches metadata without falsely claiming that the operator-owned terminal closed.
- Introduced shared cross-platform private-file primitives for the monitoring lease and MR/pipeline/CI snapshots, with Windows lstat/fstat identity checks, POSIX `O_NOFOLLOW`, bounded complete reads/writes, same-directory atomic replacement, and stale-state preservation on rejected writes.
- Defined one hashed Attention stream identity across monitoring and projection, so provider health transitions replace stale health rows, newer pipelines/builds replace older occurrences, and separate MRs or SonarQube branches remain independently actionable.
- Centralized GitLab merge-request target reconciliation so durable session bindings, catalog evidence, configured project identity, polling, status, and context insertion share one deterministic precedence rule.
- Split Jira namespace and explicit local repository into independent Work-tree and Jira-board filters, including separately persisted webview choices.
- Migrated the Work catalog to schema v2 with `linked_local_project` as the only ticket-to-repository identity; schema-v1 `launch_project` records migrate safely and legacy project tags are discarded.
- Separated Jira namespace metadata from local repository links; tickets now use only explicit operator-selected projects for launch and provider configuration.
- Generalized repository instructions so they do not assume a specific machine or workspace path.
- Clarified that the public source is available for portfolio and security review under an all-rights-reserved evaluation license.
- Renamed the merge-request browser action to make clear that Kronos opens a page but does not create an MR.
- Corrected informational pills to use the information color rather than the success color.
- Reworked realistic credential-shaped test literals so public secret scanners do not mistake fixtures for live values.

## 0.1.0 - Unreleased preview

### Added

- Four focused VS Code views: Work, Sessions, Projects, and Attention.
- Jira work board with bounded local filtering and project/branch linkage.
- Explicit validated Claude terminal launch and non-submitting context insertion.
- Read-only Jira, GitLab, Jenkins, and SonarQube clients.
- Private context artifacts, provider monitoring, transitions, and session audit.
- Manifest, runtime-graph, security-boundary, context-governance, unit, DOM, board, fixture, and package validation.
